<a name="options"></a>

## üö© Options
**tg-upload provides multiple options known as flags to control overall behaviour of the program, flags are categorized as follows:**

<a name="flag-1"></a>

**1.CONNECTIVITY FLAGS:**

Connectivity flags controls how the program should establish connection to Telegram servers, helpful for those uses proxies to bypass ban imposed on Telegram by their ISP (or for increasing transfer speed) or for those prefer IPv6 to establish connection.

Learn [here](#htu-4), how to configure proxies?

```
--ipv6 - Connect Telegram using device's IPv6. By default IPv4.
--proxy - Proxy name (in proxy.json) to use for connecting Telegram.
```

<a name="flag-2"></a>

**2.LOGIN FLAGS:**

Login flags are responsible for controling behaviour of the program during authentication flow.

```
-p,--profile - Name of your new/existing session.
--info - Show your Telegram account details as JSON.
--api_id - Telegram API ID required to create new session.
--api_hash - Telegram API HASH required to create new session.
--phone - Phone number (international format) required to login as user.
--hide_pswd - Hide 2FA password using getpass.
--bot - Telegram bot token required to login as bot.
--login_string - Session string to login without auth & creating an session file.

-i,--thumb - Path of thumbnail image (JPEG format) to be attached with given file.
-z,--caption - Caption text to be attached with file(s), markdown & HTML formatting allowed.
--duration - Duration of sent media in seconds.
--capjson - Caption name (in caption.json) to attach with given file(s).
```

<a name="flag-4"></a>

**4.BEHAVIOUR FLAGS:**

Behaviour flags controls the behaviour of transmission.

```
-c,--chat_id - Identity of chat to send the file to? can be username, phone number (international format) or ID number. By default to Saved Messages.

```
<a name="flag-5"></a>

**5.UTILITY FLAGS:**

Utility flags provides an easy way to directly use internal functions used by tg-upload without starting main client, hence there is no need to create or use existing new session (`--profile`) to use them.

```
--file_info - Show basic file information.
--hash - Calculate & display hash of given file.
--split_file - Split file in given byte, accepts only size & requires path using path flag.
--combine - Restore original file using part files produced by tg-upload. Accepts one or more paths.
--convert - Convert any image into JPEG format.
```

<a name="flag-6"></a>

**6.MISC FLAGS:**

Flags that does not fit in above categories are listed in this category:

```
-h, --help - To get help message as well as availabe options.
--device_model - Overwrite device model before starting client, by default 'tg-upload', can be anything like your name or 'My Device'.
--system_version - Overwrite system version before starting client, by default installed python version, can be anything like 'Windows 11'.
-v,--version - Display current tg-upload & dependencies version.
```

<a name="how-to-use"></a>

## üïπÔ∏è How to use?

<a name="htu-1"></a>

**1.Create a Telegram app:**

Go to [My Telegram](https://my.telegram.org/apps) and create an app and get its **API_ID** & **API_HASH** and save it somewhere securely and treat them as your bank password.

<a name="htu-2"></a>

**2.Login in tg-upload:**

tg-upload supports login as user (using phone number or session string) or bot (using bot token), you must pass the value of your **API_ID** (`--api_id`) & **API_HASH** (`--api_hash`) and a unique name for your session (`--profile`), to login as user you must pass your phone number (`--phone`) or to login as bot pass bot token (`--bot`).

```
python tg-upload.py --profile VALUE --api_id VALUE --api_hash VALUE --phone VALUE --login_only
```
now from next time whenever you need to perform any task, you just need to pass the profile name (`--profile`) which you used to create your session and you will be logged in without any authentication flow (until you terminate the session from Telegram app).

<a name="htu-3"></a>

**3.Get Started:**

Hooray! now you are all set to use tg-upload. You can try out some sample commands that will help you to get started quickly:

Get help & options:

```
python tg-upload.py -h
```

Upload files/folder:

```
python tg-upload.py --profile VALUE --path VALUE --OTHER OPTIONAL FLAGS
```

Check versions:

```
python tg-upload.py -v
```

<a name="htu-4"></a>

**4.Dynamic Caption:**

tg-upload provides variables that user can place in file's caption to make it dynamic, this variables are automtically replaced with their expected values. User must place variable name between {} to define it as a variable in string, here is the list of variables that tg-upload offers:
* `{file_name}` - Name of file without its format.
* `{file_format}` - Format of given file including '.'.
* `{creation_time[indice]}` - File's creation time or last modification time.
* `{file_sha256}` - Given file's SHA256.
* `{file_md5}` - Given file's MD5.
* `{file_size_b}` - Size of file in byte.
* `{file_size_kb}` - Size of file in KB.
* `{file_size_mb}` - Size of file in MB.
* `{file_size_gb}` - Size of file in GB.

File's creation time variable `{creation_time}` stores multiple values like year, month, day, hour, minute, second of creation and they all have their own index value inside the variable and it should be passed with variable to get specific value, if creation time is unknown then last modification time will be passed or depends upon your operating-system:
* `0`|`{creation_time[0]}` - Year of creation/modification.
* `1`|`{creation_time[1]}` - Month of creation/modification.
* `2`|`{creation_time[2]}` - Day of creation/modification.
* `3`|`{creation_time[3]}` - Hour of creation/modification.
* `4`|`{creation_time[4]}` - Minute of creation/modification.
* `5`|`{creation_time[5]}` - Second of creation/modification.

Additionally, we can also limit number of decimals places to be shown in file size, like to limit number of decimals places to 2 we need to pass `:.2f` with a variable like `{file_size_mb:.2f}`.
<div align="center">

![dynamic-caption-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87380104/233124265-a4427be6-b6cd-461a-b479-dcad599e970d.png)

</div>
Just like a plan text, you can also apply same formatting on variables, just make sure you put all formatting tags outside of {} brackets to prevent any error.

One variable can be called multiple times in same caption and user must prevent writing any other keyword between {} otherwise tg-upload will raise KeyError indicating that given variable is not yet defined.

<a name="htu-5"></a>

**5.Caption Templates:**

We can make & save our static & dynamic caption format in 'caption.json' with a name (required) and description (optional) so we don't have to write it again.

1.Open 'caption.json' file and edit it as following:

```json
{
  "captionTemplateName": {
    "text" : "main caption text",
    "description" : "An optional description to make recall easy."
  },
  ...more caption templates 
}
```

2.When needed, just mention the caption template name using `--capjson` flag.

Just like `--caption` flag, caption template also supports formatting using HTML or markdown. I already provided some general caption templates to make your work easy! :)

<a name="htu-6"></a>

**6.Using Proxy:**

Using proxy is completely optional step and can be used to bypass ban imposed by local authorities or for increasing transfer speed:

1.Rename 'proxy-sample.json' to 'proxy.json'

2.Fill the proxy details:

```json
{
  "proxyName": {
    "scheme": "proxyScheme", # like socks5
    "hostname": "proxyHostname", # like 192.168.1.1
    "port": 1234, # like 8080, should be integer.
    "username": "proxyUsername", # optional, omit or keep empty if not required.
    "password": "proxyPassword" # optional, omit or keep empty if not required.
  },
  ...more proxies
}
```

3.While running tg-upload, just mention the proxy name using `--proxy`.

## ü™ß Limits

<a name="l-1"></a>

**1.File size:**

- 2GB for bots & freemium users.
- 4GB for premium users.

To upload larger files, use `--split` flag and tg-upload will automatically split all files in given size, to restore original file out of part files, simply use `--combine` flag and tg-upload will restore original file for you (remeber to provide part file paths in ordered form 0,1,2,3...).

<a name="l-2"></a>

**2.Thumbnail:**

- ~~Only JPEG format.~~ Any image will be converted to JPEG format by tg-upload.
- Size should be 200 KB or below.
- Width & height should not be more than 320 pixels.

<a name="l-3"></a>

**3.Caption:**

- 1024 characters for all files & media.
